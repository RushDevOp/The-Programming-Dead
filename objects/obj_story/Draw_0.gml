"He served in it for more than 20 years. " +
"He was drifting through darkness, floating weightless in an inky black void. " +
"Slowly he realizes he is not quite awake, but coming out of unconsciousness; " +
"he must have passed out for some reason. Mike tries to sit up, but some unseen force holds his body down." + 
"With a note of frustration, Mike realizes again that he still not fully awake. " +
"Focusing his will, he tries to wake himself up, and for a moment it seems to work. " + 
"Mike sits up and looks around and can see that he is in a dark tunnel with very little light. " + 
"He notices a man stooped over some object to his right and tries to call out to the man, " +
"but Mikes voice does not work. " +
"Mike stood up after some efforts and walks outside the tunnel. " +
"The grass seems green, his surroundings are dark and he can smell a pungent odour around him. "+
"At first he wondered if its him! Relieved when he found out that he was not the one. "+
"Mike starts walking further and sees someone or something walking towards him. "+
"It did not take him long to realize that the smell came from whatever was walking towards him. "+
"He can see that the thing was limping when it approached him closer, "+
"its hands were red with blood, it had a small piece of muscle hanging by its mouth and yes it was growling. "+
"He could not believe that it can be a zombie. But it sure looked and felt like one. "+
"He only saw this in movies. " +
"He is armed with just his service weapon, and by the time he puts his hands over it, "+
"the zombie gets pretty close to him. He pulls out his weapon and starts warning the approaching zombie. "+
"No response other than that same growling sound. "+
"He was left with no choice than shoot at him. He took the first shot at the zombies shoulder, "+
"it did not stop it but saw more zombies approaching him. Mike quickly realizes that he need to shoot "+
"at the zombies head to kill it. He got this knowledge from his interest in zombie movies. "+
"Wondering if he was successful in killing it! Yesss, He did kill that zombie "+
"and ever since then he has been exterminating zombies. "+
"After several killings, he realizes that the programming he used to do is dead now. "+
"In anger, he looks at the sky and cries out loud... The Programming Dead! ", 100,800);
